# Project Name: RiccoShop E-commerce

Description:
RiccoShop is a full-stack E-commerce application developed with cutting-edge technologies to provide users with a seamless online shopping experience. This repository contains the complete source code and documentation for the project.

# Key Features:

Product Discovery: Users can easily search and discover a wide range of products using a search input or by applying filters such as gender, season, and more.

Product Detail Pages: Each product has its own dedicated detail page, providing in-depth information, images, and user reviews.

Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart, modify quantities, and remove items as needed.

Wishlist: Liked products are automatically added to the user's wishlist, making it easy to keep track of desired items.

Admin Panel: Admin users have access to an admin panel where they can manage products, view and process orders, and gain insights through data visualization.

User Authentication: The application employs JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication, ensuring that user data remains private.

# Technologies Used:

Client-Side: React, Redux, styled-components, Material UI, Axios, react-router-dom.
Server-Side: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT, Multer.
Persistence: Redux Persist for storing user data locally.
User Security: Bcrypt for password hashing.
How It Works:
The server receives and processes user requests, handling everything from product management to user authentication. User data is stored securely using JWT. On the client side, Redux and styled-components provide a dynamic and responsive interface. Data is retrieved from the server via Axios, allowing for seamless communication between the two.
